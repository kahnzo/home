<h2>About the site</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a web page to learn about basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP without using a framework. I like to know the basics. My hope is to document the process in a way that might be helpful to anyone trying to learn similarly. The site is not intended to help someone start a career, but merely to help a hobbist learn some helpful skills.</p>

<p>Initially, this site will use very little CSS. I&#39;m mostly just curious how different browsers parse raw HTML. As I move forward, I hope to learn more CSS, especially, how to make the site more assessible.</p>

<p>I also want to learn how to use backend and databases. Initially just PHP and mySQL, as they are popular and lay the groundwork for more complex backend and database exploration. Eventually I&#39;ll explore other things.</p>

<p>Concurrently to working on this website, I&#39;m also learning the Rust programming language. Since I&#39;m working on new projects in Rust, I love the idea of sharing that work with WebAssembly. I&#39;m working on some notes on my experience with just getting WebAssembly &quot;Hello World&quot; up and running.</p>

<p>I'm also starting to learn Linux, NeoVim, and ZSH.</p>
